        <div id="dialogue-1" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>After a long and exhausting day at work, you’re thrilled to finally be home and in the embrace of your lovable cat girl. However, as you step through the door, you notice that Rina is nowhere to be seen. You can’t help but wish she were the type to greet you at the door...</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-2" class="dialogue-content">"Rina!" <em><b>you call out, hoping your voice will coax the cat girl out of her hiding spot.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-3" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>There's a moment of deep silence before Rina reluctantly emerges, an annoyed expression on her face as she stands before you...</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-4" class="dialogue-content">"Rina!" <em><b>you exclaim with a warm smile,</b></em> "I missed you!" <em><b>Despite your genuine happiness, Rina simply crosses her arms and lets out a soft huff.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-5" class="dialogue-content">"Aww, don't be like that, Rina..." <em><b>you hum, and reach out a gentle hand to begin scratching Rina behind one of her cat ears, on the spot you know she loves best.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-6" class="dialogue-content">"Hey! Watch it!" <em><b>Rina hisses, her face contorting into an expression of anger as she immediately pulls away from your touch.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-7" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>Of course, you're used to Rina's attitude by now, so you just brush her off.</b></em> "Were you good today, Rina?" <em><b>you ask, softly.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-8" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>Still a little upset by your advances, Rina just crosses her arms once more and lets out a 'Hmph!'</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-9" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>Sighing, you walk past Rina to put down your things and finally take off your coat. Looking to relax, you shuffle over to your couch, where you delicately pat the spot next to you, beckoning for Rina to come and meet you.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-10" class="dialogue-content">"What are you doing that for?!" <em><b>Rina protests,</b></em> "I'm not coming!"</div>
        <div id="dialogue-11" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>You can only sigh and pat the spot once more.</b></em> "Come on Rina. I've had a long day. Don't you think you should treat your master?" <em><b>you argue back, another welcoming smile spreading across your face.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-12" class="dialogue-content"><em><b>Rina, offering an overexaggerated sigh, reluctantly trudges over next to you. She places her head on your lap with another huff, and you reach out to begin caressing the soft strands of hair that stick to her face.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-13" class="dialogue-content">"Hey! Watch who you're petting, idiot!" <em><b>she says with a grunt, though she makes no real effort to move away.</b></em></div>
        <div id="dialogue-14" class="dialogue-content"><b><h3>What will you do next?</b></h3></div>
